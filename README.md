Shape-screen

Screening in ChIPseq datasets (ENCODE project) looking for structural TFBDs taking advantage of shape-motif tool (https://github.com/h-samee/shape-motif). The motifs detected were crossed with disease-related genomic variants (DisGeNET) to select the matches. The resulting TFBDs were ordered based on the effect that the variant has on its structure (DNAshapeR).
